\section{Introduction}
This document is written using a modified version of the sigplanconf template.
The template renders a two-column page with a front-page which contains the article title and author's names on top.

This file is to be used as a starting point when writing documents using this template. I have saved it so that I don't need to strip out the essentials from some old report I have written using the template. This file should already contain the bare minimum (minus this section) and is ready to use!
